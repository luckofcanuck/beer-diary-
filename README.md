# beer-diary-


This is a full-stack app built with Mongo, Express, AngularJS, and Node. 

I built user authentication that securely stores passwords and login info. 
The signed in user can then look up any beer they might be drinking. 
The app performs HTTP requests to an external API, and retrieves information on said beer. 
The user can then store that beer to the database I built, attached to their user ID, and rate or make notes about the beer for future reference.
